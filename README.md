## 🛠️ Technologies Used (In Simple Terms)

### **The Building Blocks:**

| Technology | What It Does | Simple Explanation |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **React** | Creates the website | Think of it like LEGO blocks - each section (About, Skills, Contact) is a separate block that fits together |
| **Vite** | Makes everything fast | It's like a super-fast chef that prepares your website really quickly when you're building it |
| **JavaScript** | Makes things interactive | The "brain" that makes buttons work, animations play, and forms submit |
| **CSS / UnoCSS** | Makes it pretty | Like choosing paint colors, fonts, and decorations for a house |

### **The Special Effects:**

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Framer Motion** | Creates smooth animations (like how text fades in, buttons bounce when clicked) |
| **Galaxy Background (OGL)** | The beautiful starry background that responds to your mouse movement |
| **EmailJS** | Sends contact form messages directly to Chandrika's email (no server needed!) |
